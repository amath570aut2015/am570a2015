.. _syllabus:

Syllabus
--------

This course will be an introduction to interpolation and approximation of
data and functions by
polynomials, piecewise polynomials, and trigonometric series.
Practical aspects of implementation such as FFTs and the
`chebfun <http://www.chebfun.org/>`_
software will be covered.  See :ref:`software`.

Spectral methods for solving differential equations will serve as
the main motivating application, along with other approximation problems.

Recommended background
----------------------

Applied Math 584-5-6 or similar background is strongly recommended, along
with programming experience in Matlab, Python, or Julia and some knowledge of
complex analysis.

Textbooks
---------

Note that SIAM members can purchase these books directly from SIAM at
a big discount, and that UW students can

Outline (tentative)
-------------------

I hope to cover the following:

* Most of Chapters 1 - 23 of ATAP,
* Chapters 1 -4 and 9 - 10 from MMS (there is some overlap with ATAP),
* Additional material from other sources
