Homework and project
=============================================================


There will be 5 homework assignments during the quarter, requiring a
combination of analytical and programming work.
See :ref:`hwformat` for information on the desired format.


Schedule (tentative)
---------------------

* :ref:`homework1`: due Oct. 9 by 4:00pm
* :ref:`homework2`: due Oct. 22 by 11:00pm
* Project presentations: Wed Dec. 9 and Thurs. Dec. 10?


Course Project
--------------

Students will also work on a project (ideally in groups of 2) and
will write a report on the project and give a brief talk.

See :ref:`projects` for more about the class project and some suggested
topics.

Homework format
---------------


Homework should be submitted via the `Canvas page
<https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1014512/assignments>`_
for the corresponding assignment.

Written solutions should be submitted as pdf files (not Word, please).
Ideally these should be typeset using latex.  
(See :ref:`biblio_latex` for some sources).  If necessary you can hand write
and scan, but typeset work is much easier to grade and is good practice.

Computer code should be submitted as executable files, e.g. the Matlab m-file,
`.py` script in Python, or `.jl` in Julia.  
Please include suitable documentation to describe
what you've done and also explain it in your written solutions when appropriate.

Note that in Matlab you can also use 'publish' in latex mode to create an
m-file with embedded latex that can make it much easier to tie the code and
description together.

Even better is to use a `Jupyter Notebook <http://jupyter.org>`_
to produce a `.ipynb` file for Python or Julia code.  You can even embed Matlab code in
a Jupyter Notebook by using the `%%matlab` magic available in
`python-matlab-bridge <https://github.com/arokem/python-matlab-bridge>`_.

If you do your work in a publishable m-file and/or Jupyter notebook, please
submit both the `.m` or `.ipynb` file and also the resulting `.pdf`.
