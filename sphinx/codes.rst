These are from 2013 and will be supplemented by new stuff...

.. comment: See also :ref:`hwformat` for some other examples.

* `spectral1.ipynb <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/rjleveque/8798519>`__ shows an IPython notebook
  illustrating the use of Chebfun for spectral methods, following the
  examples of Chapter 21 of ATAP.

* `Fourier-Spectral.ipynb <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/rjleveque/8798516>`__  
  shows an IPython notebook
  illustrating Fourier spectral methods in Matlab, following SMM Chapter 3,
  and also Python versions.

* `Spectral-Advection.ipynb <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/rjleveque/8798502>`__  
  shows an IPython notebook
  illustrating solving the advection equation with a Chebyshev spectral
  method.

* `Spectral-Heat.ipynb <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/rjleveque/8798541>`__  
  shows an IPython notebook
  illustrating solving the heat equation with a Chebyshev spectral
  method.

* `Spectral-eigenvalues.ipynb <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/rjleveque/8798548>`__
