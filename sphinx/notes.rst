------------------

I briefly reviewed basic theory of polynomial interpolation, in particular
standard bases such as the monomials (and the resulting Vandermonde matrix), 
the Newton form, and the Lagrange form.  Most elementary numerical analysis
texts have a discussion of these.  See also `wikipedia
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_interpolation>`_.

I also reviewed Fourier series for periodic functions and the discrete
Fourier transform.  See the first few chapters of SMM and:

- `Fourier Transforms <_static/fourier.pdf>`__.
