Course Projects
==============

Students should work in groups of 2 (possibly 3) to tackle a project related to
approximation theory, interpolation, spectral methods, 
or something else closely related to the themes explored in this course.
See :ref:`projects_topics`.

I suggest working with someone who has a different background than your own
in order to maximize the amount you can learn from one another.
And try to pick a project on a topic you don't already know a lot about!

Each project will consist of a brief writeup of what you investigated
(perhaps 10 pages maximum, plus relevant computer code).

Each group will also give a short presentation (20 minutes) to the class so
that you can hear about what others did.

A project should involve reading and understanding at least one journal
article.  Some of the topics below are suggested by chapters of the ATAP
or SMM (Spectral Methods for Matlab)
books that we will not cover.  The idea would be to use the chapter as a
starting point for exploring something in more detail, finding other good
sources in the references or elsewhere.

More information will appear early in the quarter....

Possible topics
---------------

* Stability theory for barycentric interpolation, as briefly mentioned on
  page 39 of ATAP and reading Higham[2008] and Webb, Trefethen and Gonnet
  [2011].

* The Remez algorithm for finding the best (minimax) approximation.

* Chebfun2 for multi-dimensional polynomial interpolation.

* Interpolation in a region of the complex plane, e.g. choice of
  interpolation points as discussed at the end of Chapter 12 of ATAP.

* Roots of polynomials, starting with Chapter 18 of ATAP.

* Gauss quadrature and related methods, starting with Chapter 19 of ATAP.

* Carathédory-Fejér approximation (Chapter 20 of ATAP).

* Rational best approximation (Chapter 24 of ATAP).

* Padé approximation (Chapter 27 of ATAP).

* Analytic continuation and convergence acceleration (Chapter 28 of ATAP).

* WENO interpolation (Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory):  piecewise rational
  approximations that are used in methods for PDEs.

* Bézier curves and surfaces: splines often used in modeling geometry.

* Radial basis functions.

* Spherical harmonics: basis functions used for spectral methods on the
  sphere.

* Sinc function interpolation, perhaps starting with the Richardson and
  Trefethen (2011) reference from ATAP.

* Spectral methods for 4th order problems, starting from Chapter 14 of SMM.

* Spectral methods applied to some other interesting application.

* Eigenvalues and pseudospectra, starting from Chapter 9 of SMM.
