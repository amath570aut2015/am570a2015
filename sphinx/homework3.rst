  from :ref:`26oct2015`, even if you are familiar with GitHub, since it
  contains information about the class repositories and walks you through
  the next steps:


  - Clone the repository `am570-username`
  - cd into the directory this creates.
  - Edit `README.md` so the title is correct for your username and so
    that it your full name appears in the file.
  - Use `git add` and `git commit` to commit this change.
  - Use `git push` to push this change to GitHub.
  - Check the GitHub webpage to see that it appears as desired.
  - Create a subdirectory `hw3` 
  - Copy the files `cheb.m` and `p11.m` from SMM into `hw3`
  - `git add` and `git commit` these files (original version)
  - Run `p11.m` in Matlab and `print -djpeg p11.jpg` to create a jpeg file.
  - Add and commit this file and `git push` to GitHub.
  - Note that you can view the image on GitHub.
  - Modify `p11.m` so that the upper figure is for `N=30` rather than
    `N=10`.
  - Create a new version of `p11.jpg`.  
  - Add and commit these changes and `git push` to GitHub.
  - Note that on GitHub you can view the changes introduced in a commit by
    clicking on the commit number.
